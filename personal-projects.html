  <h1>Learning Outside of Class</h1>

  <h2>Clubs and Campus Activities</h2>
  <p>I stay involved with SLCC’s student community through two clubs that fuel my academic and career passions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Utah Criminology Student Association</strong> – Diving deep into justice systems, law enforcement topics, and networking with fellow future forensic experts.</li>
    <li><strong>SLCC Student Nurse Organization</strong> – Because being on track for an RN isn’t enough. I like being involved with real-world prep, resource sharing, and supporting my fellow nursing students.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Hobbies & Talents</h2>
  <p>Outside of classes, I’ve done the most — and it shows.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Healthcare & Nursing:</strong> CNA certified, dialysis tech experience, pediatric care, senior care — I stay booked and bedside.</li>
    <li><strong>Gaming & Tech:</strong> Competitive Xbox grinder, obsessed with optimizing systems and frame rates. My hobby taught me teamwork, patience, and how to set up an Ethernet cable without rage-quitting.</li>
    <li><strong>Manual Driving:</strong> I drive stick. That’s it. Jeep Wranglers, hills, and all. No stall, all skill.</li>
    <li><strong>Creative Writing:</strong> My humor and storytelling got me through trauma and straight into academic excellence. I don’t just write for grades — I write to survive (and maybe to go viral).</li>
    <li><strong>Cultural Roots:</strong> Raised in a Mexican household, bilingual with pride. I carry my family’s story with me everywhere — in every paper, every goal, every meal, and every “sí se puede.”</li>
    <li><strong>CLEP Exams (for fun?!):</strong> I took CLEP tests I didn’t even need because they were paid for. Academic curiosity activated.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Work Experience</h2>
  <p>I currently work as a healthcare professional, with hands-on experience in dialysis, pediatrics, and senior care. I also work in real estate and property management, helping clients while managing my own schedule. Flexibility, compassion, and multitasking? Yeah, I got those.</p>

  <h2>Travel & Volunteering</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Travel:</strong> I’ve visited Mexico to connect with family and roots, and I’ve traveled across the U.S. Gaining cultural perspective helps me grow — and helps my future patients feel seen.</li>
    <li><strong>Volunteer Work:</strong> I’ve helped in medical spaces, mentored students, and supported peers in both real estate and nursing. Mentoring and community engagement keep me grounded while I chase my dreams.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Services I’ve Provided</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Mentorship:</strong> For both new real estate agents and aspiring healthcare students.</li>
    <li><strong>Tutoring:</strong> Nursing and real estate coursework support — I got you.</li>
    <li><strong>Community Involvement:</strong> Volunteering in healthcare, participating in charity events, and giving back to the communities that raised me.</li>
  </ul>
