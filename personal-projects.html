      <div class="info-box">
        <h3>Clubs & Campus Activities</h3>
        <p>I did not join for a passion, I joined for the credit. Let's be honest. But somehow, between signing my name on a clipboard and pretending to care about Robert's Rules, I got involved. I showed up out of obligation and stayed because I realized half the room did not know what they were doing either. That said. Below are the clubs I was apart of during my time at Salt Lake Community College.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Utah Criminology Student Association</li>
          <li>SLCC Student Nurse Organization</li>

    <h2>Hobbies & Talents</h2>
    <div class="grid-row">
      <div class="info-box">
        <h3>Gaming & Technology</h3>
        <p>I guess I can say I play games. I used to enjoy them a lot more, until I started doing.. this. School, life, work, whatever this whole thing is. Now it's less about fun and more about passing the time without melting down. That said, I still know my way around a controller, a keyboard, and a broken system. I built this website myself, and I've got other projects in the works using Python, stuff that solves problems no one else wants to touch. It's not a passion, it's just what I do now. Because it works. And because it's mine.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="info-box">
        <h3>Healthcare & Nursing</h3>
        <p>At 18 years old, I was probably holding your grandma's hand while you were too busy with your husband and fighting over the will. At 18, I was shocking hearts back to life, doing chest compressions so hard I was breaking ribs. I was cleaning blood, calming panic, and watching people die quitely while everyone else argued. And still, to management, I'm "just 18." The same people who charge you $500 for a single pill of Advil while I'm the one making sure you don't choke on your own breathe. I chose nurisng and law because no one taught me how to look away. The two most powerful degrees in the world: one that saves your life, and one that saves your future. That's me. I will hold both.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="info-box">
        <h3>Automotive & Driving</h3>
        <p>I didn’t grow up fixing cars for fun. I’m Mexican. I learned from my dad—and no, he wasn’t a mechanic either. We just knew. It stuck. It bled into me like every other survival skill you don’t realize you’re learning until something breaks. I learned how to drive stick at 14. Now I’m the one teaching everyone else. I’ve driven on no sleep, through storms, across cities in cars that rattled like they were begging to give out. And I still got there. I know the human body, and I know the anatomy of a car. Both fall apart the same way—silently, then all at once. You either respond fast, or you watch it die.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="info-box">
        <h3>Writing & Creativity</h3>
        <p>I don’t write because it’s cute. I write because the same way someone hears a banger lyric and screams, I read a perfectly structured sentence and start banging my desk. It’s the rhythm. The flow. The punch of a clean transition that hits harder than most conversations I’ve had. Writing is the one place I control everything. The pacing, the tone, the silence. I don’t care if it’s an essay, a poem, or a chaotic mess in my Notes app—it’s mine. And sometimes, that’s all I need. A blank page and enough rage, memory, or heartbreak to set it on fire.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="info-box">
        <h3>Cultural Connection & Family</h3>
        <p>I’m not gonna sit here and say I don’t condone violence or that “it’s not the right way.” Sorry, foo—I’ve been in enough fights to know I will be doing something about it. That’s how I was raised. Not to start problems, but to finish them. I carry my culture in how I dress, how I walk, how I handle disrespect. I move like someone who knows what the consequences are—and still goes. I grew up wearing what people call “cartel-core,” like existing Mexican and loud is a threat. Maybe it is. I don’t need to prove where I’m from. But if you test it? You’ll see why López Aguilar are my last names.</p>

    <h2>Work / Travel / Volunteer / Service</h2>
    <div class="grid-row">
      <div class="info-box">
        <h3>Work Experience</h3>
        <p>I’ve done dialysis. I’ve flipped your grandma over and changed her briefs while she cried. I’m still doing real estate—managing properties, fixing issues, talking people down from fights over parking stalls. All while trying to keep my grades up and my head above water. This isn’t character-building. It’s survival. I didn’t choose these jobs because they were fun—I chose them because someone had to. And because I knew I could handle it.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="info-box">
        <h3>Travel</h3>
        <p>I’ve been to Mexico enough times to know that “visiting family” is not a vacation—it’s a reminder. The border doesn’t disappear just because you cross it. Every trip shaped how I see care, how I understand struggle, and how I learned to read people without them saying a word.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="info-box">
        <h3>Volunteer</h3>
        <p>I don’t volunteer for the hours—I do it because no one helped me when I needed it. Whether it’s mentoring someone through healthcare basics or just showing up at events with no recognition, I’m used to being the reliable one. The calm one. The one who doesn’t get credit but still makes sure it runs smoothly.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="info-box">
        <h3>Services I’ve Provided</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Mentoring:</strong> For students in healthcare, real estate, and “what the hell do I do with my life” territory.</li>
          <li><strong>Tutoring:</strong> Because sometimes you don’t need a genius—you need someone who gets how hard it is to care.</li>
          <li><strong>Community:</strong> I’ve helped with facilities, events, setup, cleanup—you name it. I’m not above any task. I’ve done more for free than some people do with a title.</li>
