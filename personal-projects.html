        <h3>Clubs & Campus Activities</h3>
        <p>I did not join for a passion, I joined for the credit. Let's be honest. But somehow, between signing my name on a clipboard and pretending to care about Robert's Rules, I got involved. I showed up out of obligation and stayed because I realized half the room did not know what they were doing either. That said. Below are the clubs I was apart of during my time at Salt Lake Community College.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Utah Criminology Student Association</li>
          <li>SLCC Student Nurse Organization</li>

    <h2>Hobbies & Talents</h2>
    <div class="grid-row">
      <div class="info-box">
        <h3>Gaming & Technology</h3>
        <p>I guess I can say I play games. I used to enjoy them a lot more, until I started doing.. this. School, life, work, whatever this whole thing is. Now it's less about fun and more about passing the time without melting down. That said, I still know my way around a controller, a keyboard, and a broken system. I built this website myself, and I've got other projects in the works using Python, stuff that solves problems no one else wants to touch. It's not a passion, it's just what I do now. Because it works. And because it's mine.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="info-box">
        <h3>Healthcare & Nursing</h3>
        <p>At 18 years old, I was probably holding your grandma's hand while you were too busy with your husband and fighting over the will. At 18, I was shocking hearts back to life, doing chest compressions so hard I was breaking ribs. I was cleaning blood, calming panic, and watching people die quitely while everyone else argued. And still, to management, I'm "just 18." The same people who charge you $500 for a single pill of Advil while I'm the one making sure you don't choke on your own breathe. I chose nurisng and law because no one taught me how to look away. The two most powerful degrees in the world: one that saves your life, and one that saves your future. That's me. I will hold both.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="info-box">
        <h3>Automotive & Driving</h3>
        <p>I didn’t grow up fixing cars for fun. I’m Mexican. I learned from my dad—and no, he wasn’t a mechanic either. We just knew. It stuck. It bled into me like every other survival skill you don’t realize you’re learning until something breaks. I learned how to drive stick at 14. Now I’m the one teaching everyone else. I’ve driven on no sleep, through storms, across cities in cars that rattled like they were begging to give out. And I still got there. I know the human body, and I know the anatomy of a car. Both fall apart the same way—silently, then all at once. You either respond fast, or you watch it die.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="info-box">
        <h3>Writing & Creativity</h3>
        <p>I don’t write because it’s cute. I write because the same way someone hears a banger lyric and screams, I read a perfectly structured sentence and start banging my desk. It’s the rhythm. The flow. The punch of a clean transition that hits harder than most conversations I’ve had. Writing is the one place I control everything. The pacing, the tone, the silence. I don’t care if it’s an essay, a poem, or a chaotic mess in my Notes app—it’s mine. And sometimes, that’s all I need. A blank page and enough rage, memory, or heartbreak to set it on fire.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="info-box">
        <h3>Cultural Connection & Family</h3>
        <p>My Mexican roots ground everything I do and dream.</p>
