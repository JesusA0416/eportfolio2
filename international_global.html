  <h1>International & Global (IG)</h1>
  <h2>POLS 2100 – International Politics</h2>
  <p>Introduction to the basic theories, concepts, processes and relationships in the global arena. Emphasis is placed on conflict and cooperation among nation-states and non-state actors. Students learn about power dynamics among international actors, the influence of theory on explanation as well as important global issues in order to build an understanding of our interconnected world.</p>
  
  <p><em>Theories, but make it war-core.</em> This course dropped us into global conflict, diplomacy, and survival of the slickest. I took the assignment and ran with it — all the way through drone strikes, democracy lies, and feminist IR tea.</p>

  <h2>Signature Assignment: IR Theory and Afghanistan</h2>
  <p>We were told to explain the U.S. involvement in Afghanistan (2001–2021) using International Relations theory. What came out was part political analysis, part academic read, part international roast session. If Realism was the strategy, Liberalism was the spin team. Here's my full breakdown, now scrollable and scroll-worthy.</p>

  <h2>Reflection</h2>
  <div style="max-width: 850px; margin: 0 auto; font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.75;">
    <p>Writing this paper gave me the perfect opportunity to look at international politics and say: “Y’all really thought this was subtle?” The assignment asked me to choose the best international relations theory or theories to explain why the U.S. invaded, stayed, and then dipped out of Afghanistan between 2001 and 2021. So I got to work, diving into the mess that is global policy, war decisions, and diplomatic branding. The deeper I went, the more obvious it became that Realism and Liberalism weren’t just helpful, they were the main characters running this show from behind the curtain. Realism gave that raw energy: security threats, power projection, regional dominance, and that big “don’t mess with us” energy America carried after 9/11. It explained why the U.S. went in guns blazing, why they stayed even when things fell apart, and why they eventually left once the cost outweighed the clout. On the flip side, Liberalism was working overtime trying to make it look good, talking about peace, democracy, women’s rights, and international cooperation. But let’s be honest: Liberalism was the PR intern. It created the slogans, talked to the media, and posted the inspirational tweets while Realism made the calls. The process of writing this paper meant juggling the aesthetic versus the agenda. It meant seeing the U.S. say one thing while doing another and realizing that international theory isn’t about what’s morally right, it’s about what’s politically strategic. I had to dig into timelines, speeches, alliances, and failed missions, all while watching governments fumble the bag and then try to retweet their way out of accountability. In the end, writing this wasn’t just academic, it was emotional. It was frustrating to realize how deep the performance runs, and how far theory can go in exposing what’s really happening behind that patriotic curtain.</p>

    <p>As the research went deeper, I started seeing just how much this assignment crossed into other fields without even trying. Like, IR theory may technically belong to political science, but let’s not play, it’s living rent-free in media studies, psychology, sociology, gender studies, and more. The entire war in Afghanistan was packaged in narratives. Media coverage shaped public opinion, trauma shaped political decisions, and cultural superiority was weaponized as moral justification. Liberalism talked a big game about women’s rights, but when you look closer, it starts to resemble performative feminism used as political currency, something Feminist theory would absolutely call out. And Realism? That girl is everywhere. From domestic policing to national elections, we’re constantly watching people make decisions out of fear, control, and power-hoarding. Like, the 2020 and 2016 elections weren’t really about building a brighter future, they were about trying to stop what people feared would happen if “the other side” stayed in control. That’s textbook Realism, just dressed in red, white, and blue. Even the voting patterns, people choosing the lesser evil instead of the best leader, tie into how states act internationally. It’s reaction over vision, defense over development. Writing this paper helped me connect all of that. It reminded me that theory doesn’t exist in a vacuum, it lives in protests, news headlines, war funding, presidential debates, and voter panic. So while this was technically a poli-sci paper, it ended up touching the soul of what every social science is trying to understand: why people and systems act the way they do when they’re scared of losing control.</p>

    <p>My final takeaway? Theory is cute, but context is everything. Realism and Liberalism helped me decode the moves, but they also revealed the mess. Power doesn’t always come with intelligence, it just comes with resources and a platform. That’s why world leaders are out here tweeting like they’re subtweeting their ex instead of leading a nation. It’s why press conferences feel more like damage control than diplomacy. It’s why wars can last twenty years, and still end with an awkward exit stage-left and zero stability. Writing this made me realize that politics isn’t about right or wrong, it’s about perception and pressure. The United States didn’t leave Afghanistan because it suddenly found peace, it left because the cost became unmarketable. And that, right there, is both Realism and Liberalism playing chess with human lives. Understanding that has changed how I read headlines, how I hear speeches, and how I interpret “official statements.” Behind every press release is a theory. Behind every theory is a motive. And behind every motive? A whole bunch of fear, ego, and strategic branding. This essay didn’t just help me complete a class, it leveled up my bullshit radar permanently. And that’s on theory. This IS theory. <strong>#MicDrop #StayInformed #BaddieWithBoundaries #NotNeutral</strong></p>
