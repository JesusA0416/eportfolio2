  <h1>About Me and My Life</h1>

  <p>Hello. I’m Jesus Lopez Aguilar — not to be confused with the biblical one, though I have pulled off some last-minute miracles involving homework, Wi-Fi, and full-on panic.</p>

  <p>I was born in Salt Lake City, Utah into a Mexican immigrant family. I didn’t apply for citizenship — I respawned here. People say if you’re born in the U.S., you “made it.” Cute. No one talks about the fine print: surprise taxes, translating government forms at 9, and learning how to file your parents’ W-2s before learning how to parallel park.</p>

  <p>My culture isn’t unique — but I am. Mexican culture is shared: passed down through recipes, roasts, and generational trauma. But I’m the special seasoning — the unmeasured sprinkle of chaos that makes the dish hit different.</p>

  <p>Want to know what’s actually unique? That one Mexican state where they eat roaches. Respectfully… you lost me at legs. Bugs? Absolutely not. A fly? Nasty. Shoo’d away with disgust. A bee? Immediate evacuation. A ladybug? No thanks. That’s a beetle with PR. A spider? If it’s visible, I scream. If it’s an inch or more, the lease is in its name. A tarantula? I'm not throwing a shoe — I’m throwing a remote and it's changing the channel on its own. If my mom screams at a rat, I scream too — not from fear, but from culturally trained solidarity.</p>

  <p>You know the phrase: “I scream, you scream, we all scream for ice cream?” No. If you scream, I’m cracking my neck, spiritually detaching, and preparing to flee. My body doesn’t have a startle response. It has a full reboot.</p>

  <p>When I say I’m different, I mean spiritually sensitive with a nervous system that thinks everything’s a threat. If someone speaks after 10 seconds of silence, I jump like I’ve been legally served. I’m not “on edge” — I am the edge.</p>

  <p>I believe in the potato sock hack the way some people believe in astrology — with blind faith and zero accountability when their crush is a dog sign. I don’t care if it’s not scientifically proven — my abuela ran a trauma center from her kitchen and I’m still here. Fevers were cured with garlic, Vicks, and stubbornness. I didn’t grow up with checkups. I grew up with vaporub and a rosary.</p>

  <p>I’m still using the same notebook from sophomore year. It deserves a diploma too. I have two mechanical pencils, and one is a limited edition from Japan that lives in a sacred pouch next to my rosary and whatever’s left of my dignity. Someone asked to borrow it once and said “can I keep it?” ¿De quién es? Mío. You say “era”? I’m tasing you. That pencil survived my emotional breakdowns — it’s family now.</p>

  <p>Hispanic families love to brag. “My son got straight As!” “My daughter got into a great college!” That’s cute. I got a working washing machine and a pencil with a bow on it. Where’s my applause?</p>

  <p>I loved tech, healthcare, criminal justice — but to everyone else, I’m just their Bluetooth technician, their bilingual blood pressure cuff, or apparently… immigration enforcement. Let me exist without a role, please.</p>

  <p>And don’t touch the thermostat. We have two — but one is sacred. Touch it, and you’re on trial. “I’ve done this for years.” Yeah? I also filled out your tax returns and taught you how to use Google. Let’s talk.</p>

  <p>I was once the kid staring at the new student. Then I transferred to Hillside Elementary and became that new kid. But it gave me friends — real ones — that I still talk to in 2025. We’re all Hispanic. We all believe in potato socks and trauma-based medicine. And we all made it.</p>

  <p>Sometimes I spiral. <em>“Para arriba, pa’ bajo, pa’ la izquierda, la derecha, el centro y pa’ dentro.”</em>  
  Not because I’m taking a shot — but because, for some reason, everyone’s chanting a biblical verse or calibrating their tequila like it’s a ritual.  
  Meanwhile, I’m just trying to calibrate my emotional state because my Capri Sun straw went in sideways and now the entire pouch is leaking.  
  Now I’m sticky, unstable, and I don’t even have a pouch to clink while someone says <em>salud</em>.</p>
